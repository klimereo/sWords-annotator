Understood! My task is to analyze the paired texts, containing the child's utterance and the parent's semantic explanation, which can be in either Polish or English. The objective is to extract the key-meaning or key words from the source text, taking into account both the parent's explanation and the child's words. The key-meaning will typically be one or two words. Please provide the examples, and I'll assist you accordingly.
