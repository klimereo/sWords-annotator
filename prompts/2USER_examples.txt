 Here are some example cases:
 
1. In some cases, the source text consists of a single word in Polish for both the child's utterance and the parent's explanation. For example: "Child: 'Kaka'; Parent: 'Wrona'". In this case, the key-meaning we want to extract is simply "CROW", which is the English translation of the parent's explanation of what "kaka" means in the child's language.

2. Sometimes the source text contains a couple of words without any particular structure. For instance: "Child: 'Bum'; 'Wybuch, petarda'". The key-meaning we aim to extract in this case is "FIREWORKS". Another example is: "Child: 'Kuku'; Parent: 'Owoce, kukurydza'". Here, the key-meaning should be "CORN" as the child's utterance, "kuku", resembles the word "kukurydza" (corn). In some cases, there may be multiple valid options. For instance: "Child: 'bzzzz'; Parent: 'Mucha/pszczoła'". The correct key-meaning in this case would be "BEE/FLY" as child's utterance is neither close to mucha nor pszczoła. In such cases, both words have to be included.

3. There are instances where the source text contains phrases with structure or incomplete sentences. For example: "Child: 'baaaaaa'; Parent: 'baaaardzo duże auto'". In this case, the key-meaning we want to extract is "CAR". Another significant example is: "Child: 'tumtum'; Parent: 'stuknąć się kubkiem'". Here, the child's utterance "tumtum" is not directly related to the key-meaning. Then we consider the parent's explanation of "stuknąć się kubkiem" (knocking with a cup), and the appropriate key-meaning would be "TAP" or "KNOCK".

4. Also, the source text might contain a person's name (typically Polish names or their diminutives) or a place name. For example: "Child: 'Ania'; Parent: 'Einstein'" or "Child: 'Sonina'; Parent: 'Sonina (miejscowość)'". In these cases, the key-meaning should not be the name itself. For the first example, the key-meaning would simply be "PERSON" and not "EINSTEIN". In the second example, the key-meaning would be "PLACE" and not "SONINA".

Also, it's worth noting that the parent's explanation can be in English, and we should still consider it during the key-meaning extraction process.
